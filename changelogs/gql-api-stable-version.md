Released stable version of GraphQL API.

The GraphQL API offers more flexible queries than the Trackunit REST APIs and only retrieves the data needed. Making it easier to quickly retrieve the data needed for your application. With GraphQL, you construct queries and mutations to fetch or modify data. Unlike REST APIs, which use multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint to handle all requests.
