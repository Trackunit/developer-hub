Released stable support of webhooks.

With the addition of webhooks, we are extending our Iris capabilities to make it easier to set up meaningful workflows by e.g. triggering actions and notifications in external systems that help you run your business. The Trackunit Iris platform collects and stores data about every event that happened to an asset. Via our webhooks technology you can subscribe to relevant event types and get event data served in real-time.  

All available event types in this release:
- alerts.asset.on
- alerts.asset.off
- faults.asset.on
- faults.asset.off
- service-management.service-status.updated
- sites.asset.enter
- sites.asset.leave
- sites.asset.archive

For more information see our [Webhooks guide section](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/webhooks-overview).
