## Foundation & Enablement

### Customer & Asset Mapping
- Option 1: Manual mapping
    - It is possible to create the Customer & Asset Mapping manually.
    - This requires the rental company to manually select the customer for each asset in the Trackunit Manager UI.
- Option 2: Automated mapping via ERP Connectors
    - By using ERP Integrations, the Customer & Asset Mapping is initiated and maintained automatically.
    - Example: By synchronizing data from the Insphire Rental ERP system to IrisX, it is possible to create the mapping automatically. This has many advantages in regards to data governance and can provide additional data points.
