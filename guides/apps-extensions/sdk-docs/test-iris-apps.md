We highly recommend reading through this section before you start developing your Iris App. It will give you a good understanding of the testing effort for Iris App SDK and how to use it.

## Testing your Iris App

### 1. Learn about standard testing in react using the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).


### 2. Install the Iris App testing contexts into your NX Workspace by executing:

```
npm i @trackunit/react-core-contexts-test
```


### 3. Start writing tests for your Iris App. 

```
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { trackunitProviders } from '@trackunit/react-core-contexts-test';
import { App } from './app';

describe('App', () => {
  it('Should render', async () => {
    await trackunitProviders().render(<App />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('app')).toBeDefined();
  });
});

```

### The big difference
The difference between how we test Iris Apps and how you would normally test a React App is that we need to wrap the App in a set of providers. This is because the Iris App SDK is using React Contexts to provide data to the App. If you wrap your test of Iris App in the `trackunitProviders()` you will get the same data as the Iris App SDK would provide using 
```
<TrackunitProviders><YOURAPP/></TrackunitProviders>
```

This way we can maintain an easy testing experience for you as an Iris App developer. We can expand the providers to include more data as we expand the Iris App SDK, without breaking any tests for you. The `trackunitProviders()` will always provide the same data as the Iris App SDK would, so you can be sure that your tests are always up to date. Its using a [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern#:~:text=The%20builder%20pattern%20is%20a,Gang%20of%20Four%20design%20patterns.) so you can override the context in your tests like mock out an graphql call or override the user context.
