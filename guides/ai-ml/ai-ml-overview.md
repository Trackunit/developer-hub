Take the next step with advanced modeling techniques, such as ML, LLMs and GenAI, to analyze data, identify patterns, and generate predictive insights to support and drive decision-making. IrisX offers tools for model training, deployment, and management with strict data privacy. It’s easy to get started start with all necessary models and tools, while maintaining end-to-end data privacy.

## What is AI & Machine Learning?
AI & ML allow customer to run AI & ML algorithms with tools for model training, deployment, and management in a sandboxed and secure environment. IrisX ensures strict data privacy, making it easy to get started with all necessary models and tools while maintaining end-to-end data security that is more and more important to our customers.

## Features
- Data management, model training, and deployment in a single toolchain, reducing complexity.
- Build, deploy, and monitor diverse AI and ML models with secure, cost-effective data integration.
- Flexible access to leading LLMs entirely run within your private workspace.
- Maintain full ownership and security of data throughout the AI lifecycle with secure integration and management.

### Train
