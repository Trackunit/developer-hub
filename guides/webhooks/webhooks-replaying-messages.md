If you missed the delivery of a message, for example, due to your service being down or misconfigured, you have the option to resend the message.

For a single message replay, navigate to Administration → Webhooks → Endpoint. Locate the failed message delivery in the "Attempted Messages" section, click the dotted icon to the right, and then click "Replay."
