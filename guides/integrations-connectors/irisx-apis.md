The IrisX APIs provide a robust set of interfaces that enable developers to integrate and interact with the IrisX platform programmatically. These APIs facilitate data access, automation, and the development of custom applications, empowering organizations to leverage the full potential of IrisX functionalities.


## IrisX Specific APIs
IrisX APIs build upon the foundational capabilities of the existing Iris APIs, enhancing their functionalities to provide a more robust and flexible integration framework. By leveraging the established Iris API architecture, IrisX APIs introduce advanced features such as custom field management, real-time data access, and enhanced analytics capabilities. This layered approach ensures seamless interoperability between the Iris and IrisX platforms, allowing developers to extend their applications easily while benefiting from improved performance, security, and scalability. As a result, organizations can harness the full potential of their data and streamline operations through a unified API experience.


### IrisX API Overview
- **Webhooks**: Automated messages sent from one application to another when a specific event occurs, enabling real-time communication and data synchronization. In the context of IrisX, webhooks allow users to receive instant notifications about changes or updates within the platform, such as new data entries, updates to existing records, or specific triggers in workflows. By utilizing webhooks, organizations can create responsive applications that react to events as they happen, streamlining processes and enhancing overall operational efficiency. This proactive approach to data handling ensures that users are always informed and can take immediate action based on the latest information.
