- **Webhooks**: Harness webhooks technology to receive real-time updates about what happens to your assets in any system. Easily subscribe to automated messages sent from one application to another when a specific event occurs and enable real-time communication and data synchronization across systems. In the context of IrisX, webhooks allow users to receive instant notifications about changes or updates within the platform, such as new data entries, updates to existing records, or specific triggers in workflows. By utilizing webhooks, organizations can create responsive applications that react to events as they happen, streamlining processes and enhancing overall operational efficiency. This proactive approach to data handling ensures that users are always informed and can take immediate action based on the latest information.
