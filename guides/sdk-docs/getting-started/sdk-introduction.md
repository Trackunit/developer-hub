The App SDK uses [NX](https://nx.dev) to manage code structure and allow easily sharing code between apps if you are developing multiple apps and extensions.
To get an idea about what NX is and what it can do, see this [link](https://nx.dev/getting-started/why-nx) or watch this [10 min introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_4WMl-Fn0w)

The plan for this tutorial is:

1. [Overview of extension types](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/extension-points).
2. [Ensure all prerequisites are available](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/prerequisites).
3. [Create an NX Workspace](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-workspace). The workspace will contain all your IrisX Apps and extensions.
4. [Create a new IrisX App](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-new-app). The app is the deployable unit that will contain all the extensions and configuration for the IrisX App.
5. [Create a new extension](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-new-extension). An extension is either a hook into a certain place in the managers UI or a report.
6. [Run your IrisX App](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/running-the-iris-app-sdk). During development you can run your app locally using the dev server.
