Once you have created the IrisX App, you will need to create an extension and connect it to the app. An extension is either a hook in to a certain place in the Manager UI or a report.

### 1. Create your first extension

```bash
npx nx g @trackunit/iris-app:extend [name-of-your-extension]
```

### 2. Answer the following questions:

- **What subdir would you like to use for this app-extension?:**
  - Trackunit recommends bundling extensions as related yet independent components of larger features. You can decide to leave this field empty, and then your extension's folder will be created in the root. If you do so, ensure to give your extension a unique name in order to prevent any conflicts. But if you are working on bigger things, you have the option to put extensions in the same subfolder. It will not impact functionality, but it helps structuring your code.
- **What app should this app-extension extend?:**

  - Enter the app name used in step 3 in the **[Creating a new app](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-new-app)** section (e.g., my-first-app).
    - üìå This question will not appear if you only have a single app in your NX Workspace.

- **Which IrisX App extension should be generated?:**

  - See the **[extension point types](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/extension-points)**

```
‚úî What name would you like to use for this app-extension? ¬∑ [name-of-your-extension]
‚úî What subdir would you like to use for this app-extension? ¬∑ [feature-name]
‚úî Which IrisX App extension should be generated? ¬∑ FLEET_EXTENSION

CREATE libs/[feature-name]/[name-of-your-extension]/extension-manifest.ts
UPDATE package.json
UPDATE nx.json
CREATE jest.config.ts
CREATE jest.preset.js
UPDATE .vscode/extensions.json
CREATE babel.config.json
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/project.json
CREATE .eslintrc.json
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/.eslintrc.json
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/.babelrc
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/README.md
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/tsconfig.json
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/tsconfig.lib.json
UPDATE tsconfig.base.json
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/jest.config.ts
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/tsconfig.spec.json
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/src/app.spec.tsx
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/src/app.tsx
CREATE libs/[subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]/src/index.tsx
```

### 3. After answering all the questions, a new extension will be created under the libs folder.

```
‚ä¢ libs
	‚ä¢ [subdir-of-your-extension]/[name-of-your-extension]
      ‚ä¢ src
        ‚ä¢ app.tsx
        ‚ä¢ index.ts
      ‚ä¢ .babelrc
      ‚ä¢ .eslintrc.json
      ‚ä¢ extension-manifest.ts
      ‚ä¢ jest.config.js
      ‚ä¢ project.json
      ‚ä¢ README.md
      ‚ä¢ tsconfig.json
      ‚ä¢ tsconfig.lib.json
      ‚ä¢ tsconfig.spec.json
    ‚ä¢ .gitkeep
```

### 4. The new extension is also added to the `iris-app-manifest.ts` file in your IrisX App under apps.

```
  extensions: [[name-of-your-extension]Extension],
```

## Example of an Extension Manifest

(in this example a Report extension)

```ts
import { ReportExtensionManifest } from "@trackunit/iris-app-api";

const extensionManifest: ReportExtensionManifest = {
  id: "your-report-id-extension",
  type: "REPORT_EXTENSION",
  main: "<path-to-report-in-jasper>",
};

export default extensionManifest;
```

Now that you have created an IrisX App with 1 extension, you are ready to run the IrisX App.
( you can add more extensions or new IrisX Apps later )
