Trackunit exposes a [GraphQL API](/reference/graphql-api-introduction) to create your query and we also expose an NX executor to make it easy to query our GraphQL API inside your Iris App extension.

# Query walkthrough

In this example, we will use a Query for asset information.  

## 1. Open a Terminal or Command Window and enter

```
npm install @trackunit/react-graphql-tools
```

## 2. Set up Graphql tooling

Look in the `project.json` file of the library where you want to add a GraphQL query and find the `name` of the project. For extensions in a subdir the name will be `[subdir-name]-[name-of-your-extension]`. 

Call this command:

```sh
nx generate @trackunit/react-graphql-tools:add-graphql --project=[project-name]
```

## 3. Create Graphql Query

Now you are ready to create React hooks from your GraphQL queries, just copy your query or the below query to your src folder in the `libs/[feature-name]/[name-of-your-extension]/src` and name it `demo.graphql`.

```graphql
query GetAssetsByProductionYear($first: Int, $productionYears: [String!]) {
  assets(first: $first, filters: {productionYears: $productionYears}) {
    edges {
      node {
        productionYear
        model
        brand
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Generate React Hooks

Call this command:

```sh
nx run [feature-name]-[name-of-your-extension]:graphql-hooks
```

## 5. Use it in your React code

Now that it has generated a folder with generated files in your `src` folder you can use it in your React code. The syntax takes the form `<YOUR_QUERY>Document`.
In the above example `GetAssetsByProductionYear` will translate into `GetAssetsByProductionYearDocument`

```typescript
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/client";
import { GetAssetsByProductionYearDocument } from './generated/graphql-api/graphql';

const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GetAssetsByProductionYearDocument, {
  variables: {
    // Any variables your query requires
  },
});
```

## 6. You are now ready to call GraphQL using hooks

For more advanced info on the executor you can read up on how to generate code from [GraphQL codegen cli](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started/installation)

More information about the `useQuery` hook is available in [the Apollo React Client docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries).

# Mutations

The process for mutation is similar.

## 1. Add mutation to .graphql file

You should start with adding a mutation to the `demo.graphql` created above or any other file with extension `.graphql` in the `src` folder.

```graphql
mutation MyMutation($eventId: String!) {
  eventDismiss(eventId: $eventId) {
    success
  }
}
```

## 2. Generate React Hooks

Call this command:

```sh
nx run [feature-name]-[name-of-your-extension]:graphql-hooks
```

## 3. Use it in your React code

Now that it has updated the generated files in your `src` folder you can use it in your React code. The syntax takes the form `<YOUR_MUTATION>Document`.
In the above example `MyMutation` will translate into `MyMutationDocument`

```typescript
import { useMutation } from "@apollo/client";
import { MyMutationDocument } from './generated/graphql-api/graphql';

const [myMutation, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(MyMutationDocument);

// Use mutation function to call the mutation
myMutation({
  variables: {
    eventId: "foo"
  }
});

// Use data, loading and error same way as for the query
```

More information about the `useMutation` hook is available in [the Apollo React Client docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations).

# Preview features

Some part of the public graph are tagged with a `@preview` directive to indicate they are still under development and may change.

To call a preview query you will need to include `TU-PREVIEW` header like this:

```typescript
const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GetAssetsByProductionYearDocument, {
  variables: {
    first: 5, // Take first 5 results
    // Any variables your query requires
  },
  context: { 
    headers: {
      "TU-PREVIEW": "<FEATURE-CODE-NAME>" // Look up the feature code name in the schema docs.
    }
  },
});
```

You may look up the feature code name in the [GraphQL Explorer](https://apps.iris.trackunit.com/graphql-public-viewer/).

Multiple code names can be send by comma separating them.

> ðŸš§ Do not use preview features in production.
>
> Preview feature may change without notice. So do not include them in critical code.

# Example: Full React Component (App.tsx)

```typescript
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/client";
import {
  Card,
  Text,
  Spinner,
  Heading,
} from '@trackunit/react-components';
import { GetAssetsByProductionYearDocument } from './generated/graphql-api/graphql';


export const App = () => {
 const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GetAssetsByProductionYearDocument, {
    variables: {
     first: 5, // Take first 5 results
    },
    // skip: <some_assetId>,
    context: {
      headers: { // Your http-headers here
        //"TU-PREVIEW": "TIME-EXCAVATORS,JUNGLE-DIGGER", // enables speicifc properties that are in preview only
      },
    },
  });
  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full grid place-content-center">
      <Card className="w-full">
        {loading && <Spinner centering="centered" />}
        {error && <div>CRASHED: {error.message}</div>}
        {data && 
          <div>
            <Heading variant="primary">We can now use useGetAssetsByProductionYearQuery</Heading>
            {data?.assets?.payload?.map((asset, index) => (
              <Card key={index}>
                <Text>Brand: {asset.brand}</Text>
                <Text>Model: {asset.model}</Text>
                <Text>Year: {asset.productionYear}</Text>
              </Card>
            ))}
          </div>
        }
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
};
```

> ðŸ“˜ Nice to know
>
> The generated `graphql-hooks` employ the [Apollo library](https://www.apollographql.com/) to interact with the GraphqlAPI. In addition to the options demonstrated in the above example, such as `variables`, `skip`, and `context`, there exist various other options. You can find a comprehensive list of these options in the [Apollo Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/#params-3).

> ðŸ“˜ Nice to know 2!
>
> In the complete example mentioned above, we have commented out the HTTP header `TU-PREVIEW:<codeword(s)>`.
Certain GraphQL objects are currently in a preview state and may undergo changes without prior notice.
To indicate your acceptance of these terms, include the HTTP header `TU-PREVIEW:<codeword(s)>` in your query requests.
The specific codeword varies for each preview object and can be found by referring to the [GraphQL Explorer](https://apps.iris.trackunit.com/graphql-public-viewer/).
You can include one or more comma-separated codewords.
