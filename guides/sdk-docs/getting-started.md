# Creating an App

The App SDK allows you to design and create applications that tie into the data stored in Trackunit Manager for your company's personal use (e.g., deep integration with proprietary data) or release an App on the Trackunit App Marketplace for public use.

The Getting Started articles will walk you through creating your first IrisX App and Extension. Trackunit suggests going through the Getting Started sections when making your first App and familiarizing yourself with the process.
