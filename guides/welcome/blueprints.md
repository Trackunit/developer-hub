Use Blueprints to Accelerate Your Digital Journey

# Definition of Blueprint
Blueprint is a set of technical tools such as data sets and code examples, available to customers to build and deploy their bespoke solutions. It aims to serve customers to reduce deployment risk and accelerate value creation.

**Why the word blueprint?**
A blueprint is a reproduction of a technical drawing or engineering drawing using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets introduced by Sir John Herschel in 1842. The process allowed rapid and accurate production of an unlimited number of copies. It was widely used for over a century for the reproduction of specification drawings used in construction.


## How to use a blueprint
Blueprints are code examples and data science notebooks to typical IrisX use cases. By using a blueprint as a starting point, users can move quickly towards value creation. Blueprints ensures low risk and faster value creation for IrisX customers. 


## List of available blueprints

### Fleet diagnostics for R&D
**Challenge**: Improve product/market fit. Design the right products
**Description**: R&D Insights to improve products/market-fit and lower costs. Iris analytic notebook that handles fleet level analysis, outlier detection, etc., from a population of machines. Fleet-wide insights, review usage trends, ability to benchmark own assets. Portfolio analysis can enable insights into price structures.
**Business benefit**: Reduced R&D costs, Enhanced product-market fit, Accelerated time-to-market


### Gen AI: LLM for documentation search or fault code analysis
**Challenge**: Hard to understand fault codes and make the correct adjustment.
**Description**: Use IrisX to leverage Large Language Models (LLM) for documentation search and fault code analysis. This includes indexing provided documentation for further LLM usage and connecting fault codes with insights from the documentation to obtain recommended actions.
**Business benefit**: Improved fault diagnosis and resolution times, Enhanced service efficiency


### Spare Parts leads prediction
**Challenge**: Lack of insight into machine usage
**Description**: Provide list of spare parts leads based upon operating hours
**Business benefit**: obtain list of spare parts leads based on forecasts of upcoming operating hours thresholds, Anticipate maintenance needs and schedule spare parts replacement proactively.


### Precise Equipment Matching
**Challenge**: Rent out the right equipment to the right customers and make changes based on data.
**Description**: Offer right-sizing equipment for rentees based on equipment usage insights.
**Business benefit**: Ensures optimal equipment utilization, enhances customer satisfaction.


### Asset and Depot/Branch Optimization
**Challenge**: Need for actionable insights about my equipment and sites to make better business decisions.
**Description**: Optimize machine availability across depots by viewing usage of machines per depot to better assign machines where theyâ€™ll be best used.
**Business benefit**: Improve asset utilization, reduce CAPEX, enhance operational efficiency


### Service Automation
**Challenge**: Need to maintain and service their assets to ensure reliability and safety at scale.
**Description**: Automate processes to operate efficiently at scale.
**Business benefit**: Alleviating manual processes.
