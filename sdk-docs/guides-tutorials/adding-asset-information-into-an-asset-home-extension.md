In an asset home extension there is a special asset runtime that allows you to query what asset is currently selected.

1. First import the runtime:

```ts
import { AssetRuntime } from '@trackunit/iris-app-runtime-core';
```



2. You can then load asset info by calling the runtime:

```ts
const updatedAssetInfo = await AssetRuntime.getAssetInfo();
```
