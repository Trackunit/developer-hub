# App settings extension point

This extension point allows you to add a configuration user interface for your app in the App library. After a user installs an app he will be guided to the app library, so this is the perfect place to add an extension if your app requires configuration.

# Administration extension point

This extension point allows you to add a new tab in the administration user interface. It will only be visible to users in the Administrator role.
