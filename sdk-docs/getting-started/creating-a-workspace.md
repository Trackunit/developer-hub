To setup an empty NX workspace follow the steps below, if you do not already know NX feel free to checkout their website [NX.dev](https://nx.dev)

### 1. Run the command below to create an nx workspace for all your Iris Apps:

```
npx create-nx-workspace@16.5 --preset=react-monorepo
```

### 2. It should guide you to enter:

```
âœ” Where would you like to create your workspace?    Â· <repository-name>
âœ” Application name                                  Â· <sample-app-name>
âœ” Which bundler would you like to use?              Â· webpack
âœ” Default stylesheet format                         Â· css
âœ” Enable distributed caching to make your CI faster Â· No
```

### 3. Go into your NX Workspace folder

```
cd <repository-name>
```

You now have a NX Workspace and are ready to create your first Iris app!

> Note that a couple of sample apps was created as part of setting up the workspace. These are safe to delete by running the commands
> ```
> nx generate @nx/workspace:remove <sample-app-name>-e2e
> nx generate @nx/workspace:remove <sample-app-name>
> ```
