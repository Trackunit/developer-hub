The SDK needs certain tools on your machine:

- Node version 16.13
- NX version 15.3.0
- Git

To manage versions we recommend using something like [Volta](http://volta.sh) or similar to install the above tools.

We don't have any requirements on IDE but recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
