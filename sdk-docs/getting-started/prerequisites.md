You need to be registered as a developer and have credentials to access Trackunit Manager. If you do not have that talk to your Trackunit representative. If you have an existing username for Trackunit Manager remember to include that in the request.
Trackunit will then make sure to enable the developer console inside manager that allows you to manage your Iris Apps.

The Iris App SDK needs certain tools to be on your machine:

- Node version 16.14
- NX version 15.9.2
- Git
- WSL ([Windows subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)) for developers working on a Windows PC.

To manage versions we recommend using something like [Volta](http://volta.sh) or similar to install node and nx.

We don't have any requirements on IDE but highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
