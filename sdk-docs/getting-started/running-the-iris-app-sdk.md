### 1. Use the NX command to serve the Iris App for local testing.

```
nx run [name-of-your-app]:serve
```



### 2. A browser window will open with this url <https://dev.manager.trackunit.com/iris-sdk-portal/main#runLocal>.
You might need to login before it hits that page, use your developer credentials.

### 3. The screen for the developer-server called _**Iris App Developer Portal**_ will appear.

### 4. From this screen, make sure to enable **Local dev mode**.
Now it will load your iris apps from your local machine and it might take around 30 seconds to load the first time.

> **Troubleshooting Tips**
>
> - If the app is stuck loading, try a different browser (Safari is not currently supported).
> - If the issue persists, ensure that you aren't running multiple instances by accident and if so, shutdown the duplicate process.
