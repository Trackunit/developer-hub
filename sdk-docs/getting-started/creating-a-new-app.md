In this step, we will create a new app in the workspace. An app is the deployable unit that will contain all the extensions and configurations.

1. Open a Terminal or Command Window and make sure you are in the workspace folder. If not, go into your workspace folder.

```
cd <path-to-workspace>
```



2. Install the SDK into your workspace by executing:

```
npm install @trackunit/iris-app
```



3. Use the Trackunit Iris App SDK plugin to generate your first Iris App by entering this command (you can use your app name instead of my-first-app within the command line).

```
nx generate @trackunit/iris-app:create [name-of-your-app]
```



4. A confirmation message will appear confirming that the command was successful.  

```
UPDATE package.json
UPDATE workspace.json
CREATE apps/[name-of-your-app]/package.json
CREATE apps/[name-of-your-app]/index.ts
CREATE apps/[name-of-your-app]/tile-manifest.ts
CREATE apps/[name-of-your-app]/tsconfig.app.json
CREATE apps/[name-of-your-app]/tsconfig.json
CREATE apps/[name-of-your-app]/webpack.config.ts
```



5. Your first Iris App will be In the apps folder. 

```
‚ä¢ apps
	‚ä¢ [name-of-your-app]
      ‚ä¢ src
      ‚ä¢ package.json
      ‚ä¢ tile-manifest.ts
      ‚ä¢ tsconfig.app.json
      ‚ä¢ tsconfig.json
      ‚ä¢ webpack.config.ts
   	‚ä¢ .gitkeep
```
