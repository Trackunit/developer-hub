The Iris App SDK uses [NX](https://nx.dev) to manage code structure and allow easily sharing code between apps if you are developing multiple apps.

The plan for this tutorial is:
1. [Ensure all prerequisites are available](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/prerequisites).
2. [Create a workspace](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-workspace). The workspace will contain all apps and extensions. 
3. [Create a new Iris App](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-new-app). The app is the deployable unit that will contain all the extensions and configuration for the app. 
4. [Create a new extension](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-new-extension). An extension is either a hook in to a certain place in the UI or a report.
5. [Run your Iris app](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/running-the-iris-app-sdk). During development you can run your app locally using the dev server.
