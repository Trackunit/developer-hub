Once you have created the Iris App, you will need to create an extension and connect it to the app. An extension is either a hook in to a certain place in the UI or a report.

1. Create your first extension (replace my-first-extension with your extension name).

```
npx nx g @trackunit/iris-app:extend my-first-extension
```



2. The following questions will appear when you run the command that will aid in app creation:

- **What subdir would you like to use for this iris-app-extension?:** Trackunit recommends using the Feature (my-feature-1) directory to sort your extensions.
- **What app should this iris-app-extension extend?:**Enter the app name used in step 3 in the **[Creating an Iris App SDK](#)** section (e.g., my-first-app).  

> üìå The 'What app should the Iris-app extension extend?' question will not appear if you have a single app in your workspace.

- **Which tile-extension should be generated?:**Select an Extension Point type.
  - **Asset Home** Allows you to add a new tab to the menu on the Asset Home screen in Trackunit Manager.
  - **Fleet** Allows you to add a new tab to the main menu in Trackunit Manager.
  - **Report** Allows you to add a new report to the Reports screen in Trackunit Manager.
  - **Admin:** Allows you to add a new tab in the adminstration page in Trackunit Manager.

3. After answering all the questions, a new extension will be created under the libs folder. 

```text
‚ä¢ libs
	‚ä¢ [my-feature]/[my-iris-app]
      ‚ä¢ src
        ‚ä¢ app.tsx
        ‚ä¢ index.ts
      ‚ä¢ .babelrc
      ‚ä¢ .eslintrc.json
      ‚ä¢ extension-manifest.ts
      ‚ä¢ jest.config.js
      ‚ä¢ project.json
      ‚ä¢ README.md
      ‚ä¢ tsconfig.json
      ‚ä¢ tsconfig.lib.json
      ‚ä¢ tsconfig.spec.json
```



4. The new extension is also added to the `iris-app-manifest.ts` file in your Iris App SDK.

```
  extensions: [myFirstExtension],
```



# Example of an Extension Manifest

```ts
import { ReportExtensionManifest } from '@trackunit/iris-app-api';

const extensionManifest: ReportExtensionManifest = {
  id: 'your-report-id-extension',
  type: 'REPORT_EXTENSION',
  main: '<path-to-report-in-jasper>',
  
};

export default extensionManifest;

```
