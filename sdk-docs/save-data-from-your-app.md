To help Iris app developers easily store extra data we allow an app to define custom fields on an asset or an account. When a field has been defined, a value can be set for an asset using the Iris App runtime.

> ðŸ“Œ The definition is created when the Iris App SDK is approved and shared across all assets. The value is set on each asset by the tile developer.
