Publishing an Iris App SDK will allow you to offer the app to customers to download and use. 

> ğŸ“Œ Before publishing an Iris App SDK, Trackunit must first approve the app.

First, you will need to create an Iris App SDK and Extension.

1. Open a Terminal or Command window and enter the build command (npx nx run my-first-app:build)  to build your Iris App SDK. Use your app name instead of my-first-app within the command line.

```
npx nx run my-first-app:build
```



2. Verify the Name and Version number in the package.json in the `dist/apps/my-first-tile.`When the Iris App SDK is published, the Name and Version fields combine to create a unique identifier for the app.

```
"name": "my-first-app
"version": "1.0.0",
```



3. Enter the Publish command (npx nx run my-first-app:publish) to publish your app. Use your app name instead of my-first-app within the command line.

```
npx nx run my-first-app:publishApp
```



4. A browser will open, asking you to authenticate your ID. Use your Trackunit user ID (email@trackunit.com) to authenticate your ID.

> ğŸ“Œ Currently, you can only publish an app using an internal Trackunit account (email@trackunit.com).
