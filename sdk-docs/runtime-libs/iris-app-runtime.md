To use Trackunit APIs and integrating with the manager to get information on current asset, site, custom fields or navigate - you need to install the Iris App core hooks. The Iris App core hooks is the interface to the manager from your react Iris App extension.

- Open a Terminal or Command window to install Iris App core hooks.

```
npm install @trackunit/react-core-hooks
```



Then you can import the core hooks in your extensions  `app.tsx`:

```typescript
import { useNavigationRuntime } from '@trackunit/react-core-hooks';
```

In this example we can navigate to asset home if you have the assetID.

```typescript
import { Button } from '@trackunit/react-components';
import { useNavigationRuntime } from '@trackunit/react-core-hooks';

export const App = () => {
  const { gotoAssetHome }= useNavigationRuntime(); 
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={ () =>gotoAssetHome("[NEED_AN_ASSET_ID]")}>MOVE TO ASSET</Button>
    </div>
  );
};

```
