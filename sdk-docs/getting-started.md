The Getting Started articles will walk you through creating your first Iris App SDK and Extension. Trackunit suggests going through the Getting Started section when making your first Iris App SDK and familiarizing yourself with the process.

The Iris App SDK uses [NX](https://nx.dev) to manage code structure and allow easily sharing code between apps if you are developing multiple apps.

First you will need to [create a workspace](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-workspace). The workspace will contain all apps and extensions. Once a workspace is created you will need to  [create a new Iris App](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-new-app). The app is the deployable unit that will contain all the extensions and configuration for the app. Finally you need to [create a new extension](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/creating-a-new-extension). An extension is either a hook in to a certain place in the UI or a report.
