# Creating an Iris App
 
The Iris App SDK allows you to design and create applications that tie into the data stored in Trackunit Manager for your company's personal use (e.g., deep integration with proprietary data) or release an Iris App on the Trackunit App Marketplace for public use. For further information, see the [Getting Started](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/getting-started) section. 

The Getting Started articles will walk you through creating your first Iris App and Extension. Trackunit suggests going through the Getting Started sections when making your first Iris App and familiarizing yourself with the process.
