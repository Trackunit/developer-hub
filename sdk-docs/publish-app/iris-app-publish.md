Publishing an Iris App SDK will allow you to offer the app to customers to download and use. 



This guide assumes you've completed the [getting started](./getting-started) guide.

1. Open a Terminal or Command window and enter the build command (`nx run [name-of-your-app]:build`) to build your Iris App SDK.

```
nx run [name-of-your-app]:build
```

2. Verify the Name and Version number in the package.json in the `dist/apps/[name-of-your-app]`. When the Iris App SDK is published, the name and version fields combine to create a unique identifier for the app.

```
"name": "[name-of-your-app]"
"version": "1.0.0",
```



3. Enter the Publish command (`nx run [name-of-your-app]:publish`) to publish your app.

```
nx run [name-of-your-app]:publishApp
```



4. A browser will open, asking you to authenticate your ID. Use your Trackunit manager credentials to authenticate your ID. It will inform you your device is activated.
   
   By device it refers to the command line interface.

5. Once the publish is complete it will show

```
ðŸš€ Uploaded the app package version 1.0.0.
```

> ðŸ“˜ Nice to know
> 
> Remember to bump the version number inside `apps/[name-of-your-app]/package.json` before you build and publish!
>
> It is not possible to publish the same version multiple times.
