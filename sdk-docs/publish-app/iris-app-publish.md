Publishing an Iris App SDK will allow you to offer the app to customers to download and use.

> After publishing an Iris App SDK, Trackunit must first approve the app before it will be visible in the marketplace.

This guide assumes you've completed the [getting started](./getting-started) guide.

1. Open a Terminal or Command window and enter the build command (`nx run [name-of-your-app]:build`) to build your Iris App SDK. Use your app name instead of [name-of-your-app] within the command line.

```
nx run [name-of-your-app]:build
```



2. Verify the Name and Version number in the package.json in the `dist/apps/[name-of-your-app]`. When the Iris App SDK is published, the name and version fields combine to create a unique identifier for the app.

```
"name": "[name-of-your-app]"
"version": "1.0.0",
```



3. Enter the Publish command (`nx run [name-of-your-app]:publish`) to publish your app. Use your app name instead of [name-of-your-app] within the command line.

```
nx run [name-of-your-app]:publishApp
```



4. A browser will open, asking you to authenticate your ID. Use your Trackunit manager credentials to authenticate your ID. It will inform you your device is activated.
   
   By device it refers to the command line interface.

5. Once the publish is complete it will show

```
ðŸš€ Uploaded the app package version 1.0.0.
```

> ðŸ“˜ Nice to know
> 
> Once you've published your app it is a good idea to bump the version number inside `apps/[name-of-your-app]/package.json`.
>
> It is not possible to publish the same version multiple times.
