Publishing an Iris App SDK will allow you to offer the app to customers to download and use.

> Before publishing an Iris App SDK, Trackunit must first approve the app.

First, you will need to create an Iris App SDK and Extension.

1. Open a Terminal or Command window and enter the build command (nx run [name-of-your-app]:build) to build your Iris App SDK. Use your app name instead of [name-of-your-app] within the command line.

```
nx run [name-of-your-app]:build
```



2. Verify the Name and Version number in the package.json in the `dist/apps/[name-of-your-app].`When the Iris App SDK is published, the Name and Version fields combine to create a unique identifier for the app.

```
"name": "[name-of-your-app]"
"version": "1.0.0",
```



1. Enter the Publish command (nx run [name-of-your-app]:publish) to publish your app. Use your app name instead of [name-of-your-app] within the command line.

```
nx run [name-of-your-app]:publishApp
```



4. A browser will open, asking you to authenticate your ID. Use your Trackunit user ID (email@trackunit.com) to authenticate your ID.

> Currently, you can only publish an app using an internal Trackunit account (email@trackunit.com).
