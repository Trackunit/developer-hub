# Project Structure
The Trackunit SDK leverages the Nx build system to generate a mono-repo structure for app development. This structure allows developers to create and manage multiple apps and extensions within the same repository. By utilizing the mono-repo approach, developers can easily share code and resources between apps, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability. The shared codebase promotes consistency across applications and simplifies collaboration within teams. Therefore our suggested approach is to have *one* workspace setup and develop all your apps and extensions in it.

## Overview
### Difference between apps and extensions
It is important to distinguish between an app and an extension as it might be confusing in the beginning.
An "app" serves as a container in the marketplace, bundling one or more "extensions" to create an installable unit. The app handles configuration and metadata such as appearance in the marketplace, installation process, and descriptive information.

On the other hand, an "extension" is where the main programming efforts are directed, as it contains the essential application logic and user interface. It is, in fact, the core functionality of the app.

In simpler terms, think of the app as the external "shell" that brings everything together, while the extension is the heart of the app, where the functional aspects reside. It's crucial to grasp this distinction early on, but rest assured that it will become clearer as you delve deeper into app development.

## Main Directories
[comment]: <Visual representation of the structure (tree diagram or screenshot)>

### apps
The `apps` directory houses the main application projects within the mono-repo. Each app project resides in its own subdirectory. The apps can share code and resources from the `libs` directory, streamlining the development process and reducing code duplication. The following files are important to understand and are created after generating an app:
- `/[app_name]`
    - `/src`
        - `index.ts`: Leave it empty as code will be injected to this file automatically when you run your app. 
    - `iris-app-manifest.ts`: This is a very important file that keeps all your configuration, such as marketplace configurations, activationMode, extensions, etc.
    - `package.json`: node dependencies for only this app.
    - `project.json`: holds project-specific settings and build configurations and is used by the Nx CLI to understand how to build, test, and serve your application or library.
    Beyond what our guides tell you to do, you likely won't have to look too much into this file.
    - `webpack.config.ts`: configuration file used by Webpack, a popular open-source JavaScript module bundler. Under normal circumstances you will never have to modify this file.

### libs
The libs folder should contain all the extensions, tools and helper-functions that you might want to share between apps. When you generate your first extension, you will have a folder structure looking roughly like this:
- `/[feature_name]`: We suggest a convention where you bundle all extensions related to an overarching "feature" under a subcategory named after the feature. You don't have to do this and can omit creating this parent directory.
    - `/[extension_name]`:
        - `/src`: This folder should house all your code. Create directories and sub-directories for your tools, helper functions etc. here.
            - `/generated`: This folder is automatically generated when you follow our graphql guide.
                - `graphql-api.tsx`: It houses auto-generated hooks (functions) that call the graphql api for you.
            - `/queries`: You should create this folder manually and put all your custom graphql queries in it. The hooks above are generated based on the queries you store in this folder
                - `[query_name].graphql`: This is one of your custom graphql queries.
            - `app.spec.tsx`: Unit tests for the App component.
            - `app.tsx`: The entry-point of your custom code logic. Start coding here!
            - `index.tsx`: The entry-point of your extension. It will initialize the App component above and you shouldn't do any changes here. Your point of interest is app.tsx.




## Configuration Files
### iris-app-manifest.ts
Possibly the most important configuration file that you need to understand.
It configures the following crucial settings for your app:
-  `specVersion`: The version of the app manifest file. Should not be changed manually. 
- `moduleFederationName`: Name of your app including workspace name, automatically parsed from your app-specific package.json.
- `dependencies`: A full list of runtime dependencies for the app. Automatically parsed from the package.json in root. The list will be security scanned.
- `devDependencies`: Same as above but for dev-dependencies. These are also security scanned.
- `validDomains`: A list of any external domains that the app needs to communicate with. The list is audited in the approval step of the app and every external API call must be listed here to get through the verification process.
- `validForAccountIds`: Put `ALL_ACCOUNTS` in if your app is available to all Trackunit users. If you want to only make it available to certain users, provide a list of account ID's as strings.
- `activationMode`: Controls how the app can/will be installed.
    - Enabled means it's enabled on the subscription when this Iris app is approved.
    - Visible means it will be visible to the customer to choose for them selves to enable/disable it.
    - FORCE_ENABLE means it cannot be removed by the endcustomer, and will be installed based on the selected subscription package.
    - DEFAULT_ENABLE means it will be enabled when a customer activates a new subscription package.
    - ALWAYS_VISIBLE means it will always be visible for all customers.
    - CONTROLLED_MANUAL_INSTALLATION means it will be controlled by the team that activates the subscription package for the customer, not activating the app.
    - CONTROLLED_AUTOMATIC_INSTALLATION means it will be controlled by the team that activates the subscription package for the customer, also adding.
    - All modes will take into consideration both **validForAccountIds** and **marketplace.allowForPackage**
- `marketplace`: Holds all the settings associated with your apps listing on the marketplace.
    - `name`: Well..the name of your app.
    - `description`: Write a small summary of your app here that describes what it does.
    - `fullDescriptionPath`: The path to a markdown file that explains your app in more detail. Store the markdown file somewhere in your project structure as you see fit.
    - `allowForPackage`: Defines with which subscription packages your app is compatible. Take great care when entering this, as your app might bug out (if it went through the approval phase in the first place) if what is stated here does not match reality.
    - `tags`: A list of relevant tags to make your app easier to find.
    - `categories`: A list of categories that your app falls under.
- `extensions`: What extensions does this app install?

It is a good idea to inspect the Typescript interface called **IrisAppManifest** in the code to get a good idea on all the configurations you can set and what it means.
### nx.json
nx.json is the main configuration file for the Nx workspace, containing project-specific settings, cache settings, and task runner configurations.

### tsconfig.json
There's rarely any reason to change these. It is a configuration file used by the TypeScript compiler. It contains various settings and options
that determine how the TypeScript compiler should transpile your TypeScript code into JavaScript, 
as well as how it should handle type checking and other features.
