# General Rules

- You cannot change a Custom Field Definition type when a definition is created. (e.g., you cannot change a string field to a number field).
- The Definition Key must be unique.
- The Default Value must be valid. (Question: What makes it a valid value?).

# Type Rules

Each field type has special rules:

- **Drop-down:**
  - If an option is removed from a drop-down list, you must provide a valid replacement value.
  - Any existing value that contains the deleted value will be changed to the replacement value.
  - If the replacement value is already selected, a duplicate value will not be created.
  - When changing a multi-select field to a single-select field, any value with more than one option will be replaced with the default value.
  - The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API.
- **Number**
  - Any existing value outside the new min/max range will be replaced with the default value. If no default value is specified, it will be set to null.
  - The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API.
- **String**
  - If an existing value is longer than the new maximum length, the value will be truncated.
  - TBD regex patterns.
  - The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API.
