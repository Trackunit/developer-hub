When running in [local dev mode](getting-started#5-run-the-tile), the app runtime will store all custom fields in local storage in the browser.

App developers can easily change custom fields and add new fields without getting a new tile version approved.

> ðŸ“Œ Any values stored during local dev mode will only be available inside the app and not in other parts of the UI. The validation rules are less strict since we only emulate a custom field's backend.
