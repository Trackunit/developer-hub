The Sites API is designed to facilitate the seamless creation and management of sites at scale - construction sites, depots, workplaces or other areas. This REST API empowers developers to interact with site information, including users and contacts of a site, assets on or related to a site and a site's comprehensive history.

> ðŸ“˜ IrisX customers can also access data connected to Sites via the GraphQL API

# Concepts

## Why use sites?
- Sites seamlessly blend live machine data with site applications to optimize your business processes, giving you a complete picture to deliver your project and business outcomes.
- Get an up-to-the-minute picture of vital activity across all of your job sites eliminating the need for ongoing manual site-level administration, whether online or in-person.

## Types of Sites 
- **Construction site:** A temporary site where structures, buildings, or roads are constructed, as well as where existing structures may be demolished, renovated, or expanded 
- **Depot:** A storage facility for assets while they are not in use. Use this type of site for asset depots, rental yards, and rental branches
- **Workplace:** A permanent site where assets are used daily, such as warehouses or factories
- **Area:** Covers any other type of sites and should be used only for creating basic alerts
