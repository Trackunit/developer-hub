The Trackunit APIs are based and organised around the [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) paradigm.  
Our APIs have resource oriented URLs, that uses the HTTP method conventions to expose our domain capabilities. We use standardised HTTP response codes to indicate errors, and JSON as our data-interchange format for both requests and responses.

## Conventions

Trackunits base URL for all APIs is `<https://iris.trackunit.com`>

#### JSON conventions

Trackunit uses JSON for both request and response data-interchange format. 

- All field names are in camelCase

A response body will always return a JSON object as the top level element.
