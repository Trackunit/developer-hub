## Introduction

The GraphQL API offers more flexible queries than the Trackunit REST API and only retrieves the data needed. Making it easier to quickly retrieve the data needed for your application.

With GraphQL, you construct queries and mutations to fetch or modify data.
Unlike REST APIs, which use multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint to handle all requests.
If you haven't worked with GraphQL before, learn how to by following [the official GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/).

The next step is to go through our guide on how to interact with the GraphQL API using the SDK: 
- [Calling Trackunit GraphQL API using the Iris App SDK](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/graphql-api)

If you want to query the API without using the SDK, you have to:
- [Obtain a token outside an Iris App](https://developers.trackunit.com/reference/access-token)
- Point you GQL client to ```https://iris.trackunit.com/api/graphql/```


## Overview of GraphQL data sources

Behind the scenes of this powerful GraphQL interface lies a collection of diverse data sources that fuel the information you interact with. These sources form the backbone of our GraphQL architecture, encompassing a range of databases, APIs, services, and more. Our GraphQL API acts as a unified gateway, enabling you to effortlessly access data from these disparate sources through a single, flexible endpoint. 

Data sources include:

- our public REST APIs, like the Asset API, Sites API, Location API or Time Series API
- our Trackunit Search Engine powered by Elasticsearch

> ðŸ“˜ Nice to know
>
> The most important datatypes are `assets` and `sites` as most other datatypes are child properties on these main ones.
Some fields are in a preview state and may change without notice.
To indicate you accept these terms pass the HTTP header `TU-PREVIEW:<codeword>` with your query requests.
The codeword differs for each preview field and you can find it by looking in the GQL schema (or explorer) above.

Our [GraphQL Explorer and Query builder](./graphql-explorer) is an interactive way to familiarize yourself with the available data models. Here you can easily delve into the underlying data sources that empower our GraphQL API, offering you a clearer understanding of the wealth of information at your fingertips.

Additionally you can also download the [Public schema](https://apps.iris.trackunit.com/graphql-public-viewer/schema.gql) of the Trackunit Iris GraphQL API.

## Advise for efficient querying with GraphQL

When querying a GraphQL API, adopting certain practices can significantly enhance efficiency and responsiveness: 

- Begin by precisely defining your data requirements using field selection, requesting only the information you genuinely need to reduce unnecessary data transfer. 
- Leverage query fragments to reuse common selections across multiple queries, avoiding redundant code and promoting consistency. 
- Utilize pagination techniques for fetching large sets of data, such as utilizing the `first`, `last`, `before`, and `after` arguments to manage the amount of data returned in each query.
- Implement client-side caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data locally, decreasing the need for repeated requests. 
- Experiment with persisted queries for often-used or complex queries to optimize performance by minimizing overhead. 
- Lastly, employ batched requests to bundle multiple queries together in a single HTTP request, enhancing overall efficiency by reducing round-trip times. 

By following these guidelines, you can make the most of GraphQL's capabilities and ensure efficient and streamlined interactions with the API.
