title: Time Series API - Introduction
category: 6489bfd3660228033fde27ec

Welcome to the Time Series API documentation. This API enables you to retrieve time series metrics for specific assets, categorized as machine insights and advanced sensors.

Machine insights provide a comprehensive list of conformed metrics, prefixed with `machine_insight_`, including ISO 15143-3 standard insights and additional insights.

Advanced sensors capture metrics originating from various sources, often derived from CAN. Advanced sensors are not conformed and allow for capturing metrics that are uniquely defined for specific equipment. The metrics are prefixed with `advanced_sensor_`. When querying advanced sensor data, you can specify a unique sensor ID to retrieve metrics for a particular sensor mapping.

The Time Series API follows the standards of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), an open-source monitoring and time series database system. By adhering to Prometheus specifications, our API ensures compatibility with Prometheus clients and tooling, facilitating integration with existing Prometheus ecosystems. E.g. [Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) supports querying Prometheus, which enables you to create dashboards to visualize, alert on and understand your metrics.
 
With our query endpoints, you can leverage PromQL, the powerful and expressive Prometheus query language, to retrieve and analyze time series data. PromQL offers a range of functions and operators for complex queries and calculations. The query responses adhere to Prometheus result formats for easy consumption and compatibility.

In addition to Prometheus endpoints, we provide a metric export endpoint for retrieving metrics in their original ingested form. This gives you access to the raw time series data without aggregation or modifications. Retrieve precise values and timestamps for detailed analysis or integration with external systems.

This documentation guides you through the functionality of the Time Series API, including retrieving machine insights and advanced sensor data. It also provides resources for learning PromQL and formulating effective queries.

Explore the available endpoints and interact with the Time Series API to retrieve valuable time series metrics for analysis and monitoring purposes.

## Interface

The API exposes an OpenAPI JSON REST interface that you can call directly using your OAuth 2.0 access token. See [Access IRIS APIs](../reference/access-token) for further details on how to obtain an access token.

## Instant Query

The instant query endpoint allows you to evaluate an instant query for a specific asset and a given point in time. You provide a PromQL query string that defines the metric or calculation you want to perform. The result of the query will be a single value or a set of values for the specified timestamp.

The response from the instant query endpoint includes the result of the query, which can be of different types such as matrix, vector, scalar, or string. The format of the result depends on the type and may include additional metadata such as labels or timestamps.

Result types:

- Matrix: A two-dimensional data structure representing multiple entries per time series data. Enables working with multiple data series simultaneously.
- Vector: A one-dimensional data structure representing a single entry per time series.
- Scalar: A single value, typically a number or boolean. Used when the query produces a single aggregated value or a specific metric attribute.
- String: Text-based information. Used for retrieving metadata, labels, or descriptive information related to a metric.

These result types allow for flexibility in representing and working with different types of data in an instant query. Choose the appropriate result type based on your specific use case to extract the desired information or perform calculations on the returned data.

## Range Query

The range query endpoint allows you to perform time series analysis of data within a specified time range.

Here's a breakdown of how a range query works:

1. Query Expression: You provide a PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) expression that specifies the metrics, aggregations, or transformations you want to apply to the time series data. This query expression can include metric names, labels, operators, and functions.
2. Step: The step parameter determines the resolution or interval at which data points are returned within the specified time range. It represents the time duration between consecutive data points in the query result.
3. Time Range: The range query selects all the data points or time series that fall within the specified time range. The start time and end time of the range are determined based on the time range for which the data is available in the Prometheus time series database.
4. Data Retrieval: Time Series API retrieves the data points or time series within the defined range from its time series database, considering the specified step interval.
5. Result Format: The result of the range query is returned in a matrix format. Each data point consists of a timestamp and its corresponding value. The matrix format allows for efficient representation of multiple time series data points over the specified time range.

By adjusting the step parameter, you can control the granularity or level of detail in the returned data. Smaller step values result in more fine-grained data points.

## Metric Export

The metric export endpoint allows you to retrieve metrics as they were ingested. It provides a way to access historical metric data for analysis, debugging, or offline processing.

To use the export endpoint, you construct a request URL with parameters such as the time range and metric filters. The system retrieves the relevant metrics from its database and returns them in JSON format.

Additionally, if the 'Accept-Encoding' header in your request is set to 'gzip', the response will be compressed using gzip encoding. This allows you to reduce the response time and size for efficient data transfer.
