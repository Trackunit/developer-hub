## Rate Limits

To ensure a consistant experience for all consumers of the Trackunit REST APIs, a basic rate limit and page size limit is enforced.
Individual rate limits may be specified for certain APIs and their endpoints. Those can be viewed in the specific API related documentation.

> ðŸš§ Rate Limits may change
> 
> Trackunit might adjust the rate limits to balance our demand and reliability.

Requests that are rate limited will get an error with a HTTP response code `429` back.


## Size Limits

In addition to limiting number of calls, a limit is also put on the max number of elements returned from our collection resources.

Unless other limits are specified in the API documentation the page size is

| Page Size         |      |
| :---------------- | :--- |
| Default page size | 20   |
| Max Page Size     | 1000 |
