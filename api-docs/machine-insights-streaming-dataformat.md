title: Data format for Machine Insights Streaming
category:
  uri: /branches/1.0/categories/reference/Streaming API
---

The Machine Insights based streaming data format provides high-level semantic information about machines. This means that e.g. information about "Operating Hours", "Fuel Remaining in Tank", "DEF Level" and "Battery Voltage" are immediately present in a normalized format - no matter the input source. This is perfectly tailored towards usage in a
data lake or in AI-based analytics.

> üìò All data fields are optional
>
> For the same machine, some fields might be filled out in one message while others are filled out in the next message; which fields are filled out depends on the technical details of the data collection. The interpretation should always be that the individual data point was provided at its respective timestamp.

The data is generally ordered in sequence, with the most recent data point appearing last, although this order is not guaranteed. If the most recent data is needed the timestamps should be compared. Any processing of historic data should be prepared to receive and handle data out of order.

## Header and Metadata information

Metadata about the machine itself is contained in the field EquipmentHeader, with the following fields:

| Field               | Example             | Description                                                                                                                                |

| ExternalReferenceNumber | Customer-assigned                      | The external reference number assigned to this machine by the customer account. |

In general the MachineId is used to navigate to the various [Iris APIs]([https://developers.trackunit.com/reference/iris-api-overview]), while the UnitId can be used to access the [Classic APIs](https://dev.trackunit.com/docs/introduction).

## Hours: CumulativeOperatingHours, CumulativeIdleHours, ...

The Cumulative Operating Hours field is a crucial parameter that represents the total number of hours the machine has been in operation. Depending on the machine type, the following fields may also be present:

* CumulativeIdleHours
* CumulativeIdleNonOperatingHours
* CumulativeProductiveHours
* CumulativeMovingHours
* etc.

The general format of the Hours fields is:

| Field    | Example       | Description                                                                                                       |

| Hour     | 42.12         | Decimal amount of hours.                                                                                          |
| datetime | 1604042795000 | [Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in milliseconds, for when this data point was recorded. |

## Machine Insights

The main fields (around 150 in total) all describe some aspect of semantic data about a machine: FuelRemaining, EngineStatus, Distance travelled, etc. The availability of these data points will vary depending on the source of the telematic data (be it GPS, CAN-bus, ISO feed, etc.). The unit of measurement for each data point will always be the same, i.e., the unit for Distance will always be "km" for kilometres. The general format of the machine insights is, with varying field names:

[block:parameters]
{
"data": {
"h-0": "Field",
"h-1": "Example",
"h-2": "Description",
"0-0": "Field with value (naming varies)",
"0-1": "13.8 \ntrue",
"0-2": "The value of the data point itself. Floating point or boolean.",
"1-0": "unit (naming sometimes varies)",
"1-1": "\"km\" \n\"volt\"",
"1-2": "The unit of measurement for this data series. Will always stay the same for the same field.",
"2-0": "datetime",
"2-1": "1604042795000",
"2-2": "[Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in milliseconds, for when this data point was recorded."
},
"cols": 3,
"rows": 3,
"align": [
"left",

"left"
]
}
[/block]

For the exact semantics and availability of these data points, please see the [data model description.](https://dev.trackunit.com/docs/trackunit-data-model)

## CANMessages

> üìò This is low-level data
>
> Most of the CAN data has been interpreted to Machine Insights by Trackunit. CANMessages are not normalized, and not data cleansed to the same degree. CANMessages should only be necessary if something particular is needed.We recommend looking at the other fields first.

CAN messages is data directly from the CAN bus of the machine. In general a working knowledge of the CAN bus, and sometimes the specific CAN bus of a machine, is needed to interpret this data. The CANMessages field is an array, where each element has the following format:

[block:parameters]
{
"data": {
"h-0": "Field",
"h-1": "Example",
"h-2": "Description",
"0-0": "datetime",
"0-1": "1604042795000",
"0-2": "[Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in milliseconds, for when this data point was recorded.",
"1-0": "UnitOfMeasurement",
"1-1": "\"%\" \n\"rpm\"",
"1-2": "The unit of measurement, as specified in the CAN profile; not normalized.",
"2-0": "VariableId",
"2-1": "212",
"2-2": "The internal Trackunit VariableId for this data item.",
"3-0": "VariableName",
"3-1": "\"Engine Speed\"",
"3-2": "The name corresponding to the VariableId.",
"4-0": "ParsedValue",
"4-1": "1234.5678 \n\"the value\"",
"4-2": "The parsed value; either a double or a string."
},
"cols": 3,
"rows": 5,
"align": [
"left",
"left",
"left"
]
}
[/block]

More detail about the value collected is available in the "CanMessageValues" field which can be one of these types:

[block:parameters]
{
"data": {
"h-0": "Type",
"h-1": "Fields",
"h-2": "Description",
"0-0": "CanMessageValue",
"0-1": "value",
"0-2": "A single value was picked up in the capturing interval.",
"1-0": "CanMessageMinMax",
"1-1": "MinValue \nMaxValue",
"1-2": "A minimum and maximum value was picked up in the capturing interval.",
"2-0": "CanMessageAccumulated",
"2-1": "value",
"2-2": "The sum of all observed values in the capturing interval was picked up."
},
"cols": 3,
"rows": 3,
"align": [
"left",
"left",
"left"
]
}
[/block]

More details about how the data was picked is available in the "CanMessageData" field, which has the following subfields:

[block:parameters]
{
"data": {
"h-0": "Field",
"h-1": "Example",
"h-2": "Description",
"0-0": "CanId",
"0-1": "217056257",
"0-2": "The CAN identifier of the data that was picked up.",
"1-0": "SourceAddress",
"1-1": "0",
"1-2": "The CAN source address of the data that was picked up.",
"2-0": "BinaryValue",
"2-1": "-",
"2-2": "The bits themselves that was picked up.",
"3-0": "Counter",
"3-1": "1234",
"3-2": "The number of data items that where seen in the capturing period matching this CAN data item.",
"4-0": "CapturingPeriod",
"4-1": "120",
"4-2": "The number of seconds the capturing period lasted.",
"5-0": "CanType",
"5-1": "\"Can A\" \n\"Can B\"",
"5-2": "The type of CAN bus."
},
"cols": 3,
"rows": 6,

]
}
[/block]

## AdvancedSensors

> üìò Higher-level custom sensor data
>
> Only available as early access and one must contact Trackunit to get this.
>
> AdvancedSensors provides a simple view of sensor readings from different sources. Some of this data has been interpreted to Machine Insights by Trackunit, and it is recommended to use those when available. When that is not the case AdvancedSensors can be used to access data from sources such as; Modbus, CAN bus, Bluetooth and other. It is the recommended approach to read this type of data as it provides richer state support than CanMessages.

While CanMessages remains available for low-level CAN data, AdvancedSensors should be used in all other cases where non-Machine Insights data is required. By default, AdvancedSensors contains data from Modbus, API integrations and Bluetooth tags. In order to fully use AdvancedSensors for all sensor data there is a migration path where CanMessages are duplicated to AdvancedSensors until eventually only AdvancedSensors are available. The AdvancedSensors field is an array, where each element has the following format:

[block:parameters]
{
"data": {
"h-0": "Field",
"h-1": "Example",
"h-2": "Description",
"0-0": "datetime",
"0-1": "1604042795000",
"0-2": "[Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in milliseconds when this sensor reading was taken.",
"1-0": "UnitOfMeasurement",
"1-1": "\"¬∞C\"",
"1-2": "Unit for NumericValue; normalized across messages.",
"2-0": "SensorId",
"2-1": "212",
"2-2": "Numeric ID of the sensor (same as VariableId).",
"3-0": "SensorName",
"3-1": "\"Engine Temperature\"",
"3-2": "Human-readable name of the sensor (same as VariableName).",
"4-0": "NumericValue",
"4-1": "85.3",
"4-2": "Parsed numeric reading, if available.",
"5-0": "StringValue",
"5-1": "\"ON\" \n\"OFF\"",
"5-2": "Parsed string reading (e.g., state sensors), if available.",
"6-0": "Source",
"6-1": "\"MODBUS\" \n\"CAN1\"",
"6-2": "Origin of the reading (MODBUS, CAN1, CAN2, ONEI3, BLUETOOTH_TAG, API_INTEGRATION, OTHER)."
},
"cols": 3,
"rows": 7,
"align": ["left","left","left"]
}
[/block]

AdvancedSensors entries may include one or both of NumericValue and StringValue depending on the sensor. State sensors often populate both, whereas purely numeric sensors use only NumericValue. The Source enum indicates the data source of the data.

## FaultCodes

FaultCodes contain an array of faults that occurred on a machine, typically because they were present on the CAN bus, but they could also be imported from an ISO feed or similar sources. Each element in the array has the following fields:

[block:parameters]
{
"data": {
"h-0": "Field",
"h-1": "Example",
"h-2": "Description",
"0-0": "CodeIdentifier",
"0-1": "\"1234-56\" \n\"Free text\"",
"0-2": "The identifier for the fault; for CAN errors this will normally be \"SPN-FMI\", but for other sources this is entirely free text.",
"1-0": "CodeDescription",
"1-1": "\"Engine Fuel Delivery Pressure too low\"",
"1-2": "The interpretation of the fault that Trackunit knows and shows in Manager.",
"2-0": "CodeSeverity",
"2-1": "\"67\" \n\"Low\", \"High\", \"Free text\"",
"2-2": "The severity of the fault; if originating from a Trackunit device it will be between 0 and 100; from other sources this can be free text.",
"3-0": "CodeSource",
"3-1": "\"0\" \n\"Engine\"",
"3-2": "The source where the fault originates from; for CAN errors this will normally be the CAN source address; from other sources this can be free text.",
"4-0": "datetime",
"4-1": "1604042795000",
"4-2": "[Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in milliseconds, for when this fault started appearing.",
"5-0": "datetimeCleared",
"5-1": "null \n1604046795000",
"5-2": "[Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in milliseconds, for when this fault stopped appearing, or null if still present or unknown. \nFor CAN errors there will normally be one message with datetimeCleared = null, followed at a later time by a message with datetimeCleared != null. From other sources, this behaviour is not guaranteed."

## Trackunit Kin

For messages related to Trackunit Kin tags, EquipmentHeader contains asset data on which the Kin tag is onboarded. Metadata consists of Kin serial number and asset ID (as MachineId field).
