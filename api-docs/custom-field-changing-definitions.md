When changing custom field definitions, you need to follow the following general rules and type-specific rules:

### General Rules
-   You cannot change a Custom Field Definition `type` after creation (e.g., changing a string field to a number field).
-   The Definition `key` (if specified) must be unique (within your account).

### Type Rules
Each field type has special rules:

-   **Drop-down:**
    
	-   If an option is removed from a drop-down list, you must provide a valid replacement value.
	    
	-   Any existing value that contains the deleted value will be changed to the replacement value.
	    
	-   If the replacement value is already selected, a duplicate value will not be created.
	    
	-   When changing a multi-select field to a single-select field, any value with more than one option will be cleared.
	    
	-   The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API in the `lastIncompatibleValue` field.
    
-   **Number**
    
	-   Any existing value outside the new min/max range will be set to null.
	    
	-   The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API in the `lastIncompatibleValue` field.
    
-   **String**
    
	-   If an existing value is longer than the new maximum length, the value will be truncated.
	    
	-   The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API in the `lastIncompatibleValue` field.

	- Regex patterns can be changed, but be warned that existing data can become uncompliant with the new pattern.
