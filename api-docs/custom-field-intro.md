## How to set values on standard fields

1. Use the [Custom Fields Values API](/reference/custom-fields-get-values) to get all available fields. Specify the `entityId` for your query, which is an assetId for any fields listed above.
2. Use the `Create`, `Update` or `Delete value` endpoints for any futher operations on the available fields.

# Define your own custom fields

Custom fields provide a way to define new fields in the Trackunit data model. Allowing to extend and customize Trackunit Manager. Currently we support **extending the data model of assets, accounts, groups, sites, customers and rental contracts with new fields**.

> IrisX is required to create and change custom field definitions. Learn more about the [IrisX subscription](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/irisx-overview)


## Get started with creating custom fields

1. To define a custom field, you first need to [add a definition using the API.](/reference/custom-field-definitions)
2. Use the [Custom Fields Values API](/reference/custom-field-values) to set values on your defined custom fields. Specify the `entityId` for your query. Depending on which domain type you are interested in, this can be an assetId, accountId, groupId, siteId, customerId or rentalContractId.

## Changing custom field definitions

When changing custom field definitions, you need to follow the following general rules and type-specific rules:

### General rules
-   You cannot change a Custom Field Definition `type` after creation (e.g., changing a string field to a number field).
-   The Definition `key` (if specified) must be unique (within your account).

### Type rules
Each field type has special rules:

-   **Drop-down:**
    
	-   If an option is removed from a drop-down list, you must provide a valid replacement value.
	    
	-   Any existing value that contains the deleted value will be changed to the replacement value.
	    
	-   If the replacement value is already selected, a duplicate value will not be created.
	    
	-   When changing a multi-select field to a single-select field, any value with more than one option will be cleared.
	    
	-   The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API in the `lastIncompatibleValue` field.
    
-   **Number**
    
	-   Any existing value outside the new min/max range will be set to null.
	    
	-   The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API in the `lastIncompatibleValue` field.
    
-   **String**
    
	-   If an existing value is longer than the new maximum length, the value will be truncated.
	    
	-   The existing value will be saved for retrieval in the API in the `lastIncompatibleValue` field.

	- Regex patterns can be changed, but be warned that existing data can become uncompliant with the new pattern.
