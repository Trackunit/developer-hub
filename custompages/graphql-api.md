## Introduction
To create integrations and retrieve data use the GraphQL API. The GraphQL API offers more flexible queries than the TrackUnit REST API and only retrieves the data needed.

If you haven't already, it is reccommended to go through our example on how to interact with the GraphQL API using the SDK: 
- [Calling Trackunit GraphQL API using the Iris App SDK](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/graphql-api)

If you want to call the API without using the SDK, you have to fetch your authentication token first and familiarize yourself with the available data models:
- [Obtain a token outside an Iris App](https://developers.trackunit.com/reference/access-token)
- [GraphQL Explorer and Query builder](./graphql-explorer)

Click below to download the public schema if you need it:

## Types and fields
The most important datatypes are `assets` and `sites` as most other datatypes are child properties on these main ones.
> ðŸ“˜ Nice to know
>
> Some fields are in a preview state and may change without notice.<br>
> To indicate you accept these terms pass the HTTP header `TU-PREVIEW: <codeword>` with your query requests.<br>
> The codeword differs for each preview field and you can find it by looking in the GQL schema above.

### Assets
An Asset represents the machines and equipment that have our sensors attached to them.
