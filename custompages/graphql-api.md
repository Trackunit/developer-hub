## Introduction
To create integrations and retrieve data use the GraphQL API. The GraphQL API offers more flexible queries than the TrackUnit REST API and only retrieves the data needed.

If you haven't already, it is reccommended to go through our example on how to interact with the GraphQL API using the SDK: 
- [Calling Trackunit GraphQL API using the Iris App SDK](https://developers.trackunit.com/docs/graphql-api)

If you want to call the API without using the SDK, you have to fetch your authentication token first and familiarize yourself with the available data models:
- [Obtain a token outside an Iris App](https://developers.trackunit.com/reference/access-token)
- [GraphQL Explorer and Query builder](./graphql-explorer)

## Types and fields
The most important datatypes are `assets` and `sites` as most other datatypes are child properties on these main ones.
